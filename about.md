I am a DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford supervised by [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/). I also spend two days a week as a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/). Previously, I received my MSc. from the University of Toronto supervised by [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/). I was one of the primary contributors to the [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) project. My research interests are probabilistic inference and Monte Carlo methods. My other interests include neural networks, learning in non-human animals, and probability theory.
