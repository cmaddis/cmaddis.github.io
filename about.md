This is a personal blog of Chris J. Maddison covering statistical machine learning with a specific focus on cool tricks and forgotten papers.

Chris is a DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford supervised by [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and [Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/). He also spends two days a week as a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/). Previously, he received his MSc. from the University of Toronto supervised by [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/). He was one of the primary contributors to the [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) project. His research interests are probabilistic inference and Monte Carlo methods. His other interests include neural networks, learning in non-human animals, and probability theory.
